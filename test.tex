\section*{Some Really Cool Math}

One way to think about the integral is as a continuous discrete sum ($\int \rightarrow \sum$). Much in the same way the derivative is phrased as the limiting case of a finite difference over decreasing interval $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, an integral is defined in the context of sums over intervals of decreasing width subtending an area incident to the function and its independent variable's axis.

\[ \displaystyle \int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx = 1 \]
